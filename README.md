### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

My name is Miguel Vargas and I am 16 years old
I am from Colombia and I am currently ending my high school studies.
My interest in learning about computers started back in 2015 when I was 9 years old
and I started to learn about computers.

**Achalogy** 
I have knowledge about computers and development that I learn with an autodidact learning, just for fun. Here are a few technologies I have been using this last years:

  * Javascript / Node Js
  * Python
  * React - Nextjs
  * Nest js
  * React Native
